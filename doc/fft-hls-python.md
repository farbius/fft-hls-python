## Theory
Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a finite-length sequence of length *N* is

$$X[k]  =\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x[n] W_{N}^{kn}, \qquad k = 0,1,...,N-1.\qquad (1.1)$$

where $W_{N}^{kn} = e^{-j(2\pi kn/N)}$.

<p align="justify">
Direct computation of $X[k]$ requires a total of $N^2$ complex multiplications and $N(N-1)$ complex additions.
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)  is <i>exactly</i> the same DFT with optimization by reducing number of computations.
All optimizations for improving the efficiency of the computation are based on the symmetry and periodicity properties of   $W_{N}^{kn}$ [1], specifically,

$$W_{N}^{k[N - n]} =W_{N}^{-kn} = (W_{N}^{kn})^* \qquad (symmetry ) \qquad (1.2)$$


$$W_{N}^{kn} =W_{N}^{k(n+N)} = W_{N}^{(k+N)n} \qquad (periodicity) \qquad (1.3)$$


For explanation let's consider direct calculation of two samples of  $X[k]$ from Eq. (1.1) for $N=8$

$$X[2]  =x[0] W_{8}^{0} + x[1] W_{8}^{2} + x[2] W_{8}^{4}+x[3] W_{8}^{6} + x[4] W_{8}^{8} + x[5] W_{8}^{10}+ x[6] W_{8}^{12} + x[7] W_{8}^{14} \qquad$$

$$X[3]  =x[0] W_{8}^{0} + x[1] W_{8}^{3} + x[2] W_{8}^{6}+x[3] W_{8}^{9} + x[4] W_{8}^{12} + x[5] W_{8}^{15}+ x[6] W_{8}^{18} + x[7] W_{8}^{21} \qquad$$

By using the periodicity property of   $W_{N}^{kn}$ and the fact that  $W_{N}^{N/2} =  e^{-j(2\pi/N)N/2}=-1$, we obtain

$$X[2]  =x[0] W_{8}^{0} + x[1] W_{8}^{2} - x[2] W_{8}^{0}-x[3] W_{8}^{2} + x[4] W_{8}^{0} + x[5] W_{8}^{2}- x[6] W_{8}^{0} - x[7] W_{8}^{2} \qquad$$

$$X[3]  =x[0] W_{8}^{0} + x[1] W_{8}^{3} - x[2] W_{8}^{2}+x[3] W_{8}^{1} - x[4] W_{8}^{0} - x[5] W_{8}^{3}+ x[6] W_{8}^{2} - x[7] W_{8}^{1} \qquad$$

<p align="justify">
By reducing number of $W_{N}^{kn}$ we may group corresponding pairs of $x[n]$  samples with equal coefficients, that allow to decrease number of multiplications. Also coefficients transformation can be explained by Fig. (1.1)

<b>Figure 1.1 </b> Transformation of coefficients
</div>
<br/>

As seen from Fig. (1.1) , it is enough to compute and store only $N/2$ of coefficients. This is the main advantage of periodocity property of $W_{N}^{kn}$. By applying both the symmetry and periodicity property  for coefficients and grouping input data the following dataflow for 8-point DFT computation can be implemented

<br/> 

<p align="justify">
This implementation requires number of multiplications and additions is equal  to $N\log_2N$ , what is significantly less then for direct implementation of DFT $N^2$. The reduction extremelly grows up with the increasing number of DFT points. (Here I'm focused only on decimation-in-time algorithm of FFT, but of course there is amount of other algorithms for implementation FFT).
FFT implementation consist of $\log_2N$ stages and $N/2$ butterflies for every stage. The butterfly is a unit of FFT that implemets 2-point DFT with  one  $W_{N}^{kn}$ coefficient  Fig. (1.3)

<p align="center">

</p>

<div align="center">
<b>Figure 1.3 </b> Flow graph of basic butterfly computation
</div>
<br/> 

Associated equations for a butterfly from Fig. (1.3)

$$X_m[p] =X_{m-1}[p] + W_N^rX_{m-1}[q]  \qquad (1.4)$$
$$X_m[q] =X_{m-1}[p] - W_N^rX_{m-1}[q]  \qquad (1.5)$$

<p align="justify">
The batterfly requires only one complex multiplication $W_N^rX_{m-1}[q]$ and $N\log_2N$ multiplication for computing FFT overall. For example, 8-point FFT requires 24  complex multipliers as can be seen from Fig. (1.2).
Apart of butterfly calculation it is necessary to reoder input data for the first stage. 
Reordering involves <i>bit-reversal</i> algorithm, when every bit of input data index binary form is reversed. For example, indexes for  $N = 8$ will be reorder like

<p align="justify">

| Normal Index| Binary form of normal index |Binary form of reserved index|Reserved index|
| :-: | :-:| :-:| :-:|
| 0 | 000 | 000 | 0 |
| 1 | 001 | 100 | 4 |
| 2 | 010 | 010 | 2 |
| 3 | 011 | 110 | 6 |
| 4 | 100 | 001 | 1 |
| 5 | 101 | 101 | 5 |
| 6 | 110 | 011 | 3 |
| 7 | 111 | 111 | 7 |



Summarize the information above, FFT implementation requires (decimation-in-time Cooleyâ€“Tukey FFT algorithm):
1. butterfly for complex multiplication on every stage
1. set of complex coefficients
1. input signal reodering

## Mathematical Modelling


<p align="justify">
Mathematical modelling of FFT allows to figure out <i>hardware design</i> of the algorithm and proof outputs during HLS Co-Simulation. 
<br>
For mathematical modelling two Python scripts were created: <i>signal_generator.py</i> and <i>fft_model.py</i>.  First script generates a synthetic complex signal for HLS testbench and header <i>coef_init.h</i> file for initialization of HLS FFT implementation. The script may be launching with, for example,the following arguments

```sh
python3 signal_generator.py 1024 3 40
```
what means - the synthetic signal consist of 1024 samples and is composed from 3 signals with Signal-To-Noise ratios 40 dB, 38 dB, 36 dB. 
Code for parsing the arguments is 

```sh
parser.add_argument('Npoints' ,default=None, type=int)
parser.add_argument('Nsignals',default=None, type=int)
parser.add_argument('SNR_dB'  ,default=None, type=int)
```

<p align="justify">
where <i>Npoints</i>  is a number of FFT points, 
<i>Nsignals</i> - is an amount of harmonics with random frequencies in the synthetic signal and <i>SNR_dB</i> - is a max value of Signal-To-Noise ratio of the first harmonic in the synthetic signal, SNR of other harmonics will be decreased on 2 dB for every one.
Mathematical model of the complex synthetic signal is

$$x_k[n] = 10^{(SNR_{dB}-2k)/20}e^{-j2\pi f_k n/Npoints} + n_k[n] \qquad (2.1)$$
<p align="justify">
where $n = 0 ... Npoints-1$ - signal's sample, $k = 0 ... Nsignals-1$ - harmonic's number, $n_k$ - random noise for every harmonic.
Frequency meaning $f_k$ of harmonic  is choosen randomly and a power is decreased for every harmonic on 2 dB.
<br>
After calculation in Eq. (2.1) the amplitude of synthetic sum signal is scaled to <i>-1 ... +1</i> and <i>-32768 ... +32768</i> and samples are saved to files.
<br>
The script will generate several files:

```sh
nonscaled_re.txt  
nonscaled_im.txt
scaled_re.txt
scaled_im.txt
coef_init.h
```

<p align="justify">
Header <i>coef_init.h</i> consist of FFT parameters and scaled to  <i>-32768 ... +32768</i> coefficients. The header file is used by HLS FFT implementation. 
Files <i>nonscaled_.txt</i> are complex float point input for Numpy FFT implementation, that will be used for comparison with HLS FFT implementation. 
Files <i>scaled_.txt</i> are scaled to 16-bit signed register complex input for HLS FFT.
<br>
The <i>fft_model.py</i> python script consists of scaled to 16-bits signed register implementation of FFT and FFT from Numpy package. The script reads out <i>scaled_.txt</i> and <i>nonscaled_.txt</i> data, output <i>cmpx_hls.txt</i> from HLS Co-simulation and plots results of three FFT. 
<br>
Result for <i>python3 signal_generator.py 1024 3 40</i> is depicted on Fig. (2.1)

<div align="center">
<b>Figure 2.1 </b> Results of Numpy, Python and HLS FFT implementation
</div>
<br/> 
<p align="justify">
First plot is a power of FFT output implemented in Numpy (green), Python (red) and HLS Co-simulation (blue). Since Python and HLS implementation is scaled to 16-bit signed register, thir nois floor is restricted by Root Means Square (RMS) value, that depends on length of a register. In case of 16-bit signed register, minimum level of power spectrum can be 

$$SNR_{RMS} = 6.02 * 15 + 1.76 = 92.06 \  dB$$

<p align="justify">
FFT itself without scaling, expands power spectrum range on value 

$$SNR_{FFT} = 10*\log_{10}(Npoints)  \  dB$$
<p align="justify">
Noise floor reduction in FFT is caused by narrow-bandness  of FFT itself [2]. For demonstration the noise floor reduction, let's consider two noise 1024-points  signals with amplitude 0 dB and -20 dB in the following Python script

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Npoints = 1024
SNR_1 = 0
SNR_2 = -20

n_1 = 10**(SNR_1/20)*np.random.randn(Npoints)
n_2 = 10**(SNR_2/20)*np.random.randn(Npoints)

# normalized Numpy FFT 
nf_1 = np.abs(np.fft.fft(n_1)/Npoints)
nf_2 = np.abs(np.fft.fft(n_2)/Npoints)

plt.figure()
plt.plot(20*np.log10(nf_1), '.-r', label='nf_1 SNR = 0 dB')
plt.plot(20*np.log10(nf_2), '.-b', label='nf_2 SNR = -20 dB')
plt.title("FFT {} points, FFT noise floor is {:3.2f} dB".format(Npoints, 10*np.log10(Npoints)), fontweight="bold", fontsize=14)
plt.legend(loc='upper right')
plt.grid()
plt.xlabel('bin')
plt.ylabel('power, dB')
plt.show()
```

<div align="center">
<b>Figure 2.2 </b> FFT noise floor reduction
</div>
<br/> 
<p align="justify">
As can be seen from Fig. (2.2)  noise floor was moved on 30 dB since 1024-point FFT was applied (30 dB).
<br>
<p align="justify">
Second plot in Fig. (2.1) is a result of comparison Python FFT implementation and HLS Co-simulation output. The small error is caused by rounding operation during FFT computation. 




## High Level Synthesis Implementation


<p align="justify">
Hardware Design is a key point before implementation.
Hardware design allows to figure out what kind of resourses (BRAM, DSP, LUTs)
and how many are required for an algorithm implementation, what optimization (area, latency, throughput) can be applied.
For example, FFT Hardware Design for $log_2N$ stages and <i>N</i> points is depicted on Fig. (3.1)

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/farbius/fft-hls-python/blob/main/doc/images/hw_design.png" alt="butterfly"/>
</p>

<div align="center">
<b>Figure 3.1 </b> FFT hardware design for HLS
</div>
<br/>

<p align="justify">
The Hardware Design includes pre-processing stage for bit-reversing and further stages for computation (<i>n_stage</i>). External interface is fully pipelined AXI STREAM. 
During pre-processing stage input data is stored according bit-reversed indexes into BRAM memory. 
Every stage for computation takes pair of data from 2-ports BRAM and does calculation. Final stage pushes data into AXI STREAM interface.
Throughput, area, latency of the Hardware Design (pipelining) is provided by applying some optimization HLS techniques (directives) [3].
<br/>

<i>Bit-reversing or pre-processing</i>
<br/>

<p align="justify">
Bit-reversing algorithm is implemented in pre-processing stage and does data reading from one memory and storing to another.

		y[idx_r]= x[idx_d];
	} // revst_L
} // reverse_stage

```

</details>

<p align="justify">
Here the directive <b>HLS INLINE for</b> <i>T revBits(T Addr)</i> function was applied. The directive removes the function as separate entity 
in the HLS hierarchy - in other words, the directive built the function into the <i>void reverse_stage(T x[NPOINTS], T y[NPOINTS])</i> and represents 
both functions as one entity. Two BRAM blocks are involved in the pre-processing stage as interfaces.

<br/>

<i>n-stage, butterfly implementation</i>
<br/>

<p align="justify">
The Butterfly implements 2-points decimation-in-time DFT algorithm. The algorithm involves complex multiplier, addition and substraction arithmetic operation.
The algorithm's implementation is based on 3 DSP blocks, fully pipelined and has three clocks latency. In addition butterfly's output 
is scaled in order to avoid overflowing.

There are several important directives for improving throughtput and reserving certan resources. For example, <b>HLS ARRAY_PARTITION</b> allows 
to divide 2 dimentional <i>mem_bram</i> array into several arrays or 2-ports BRAM blocks, <b>HLS UNROLL</b> is for unrolling <i>for</i> loop, 
since every FFT stage can be computed only in sequence, that's why pipelining here is not allowed. 
Directive <b>HLS DATAFLOW</b> plays significal role in order to provide pipelining on task-level and increasing the overall throughput (Fig. (3.2)). 
In other words, the directive arranges all stages for providing computation as soon as possible. For example, every stage can accept new data 
after the last two points were read out to butterfly.
